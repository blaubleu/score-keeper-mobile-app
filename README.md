# Cuarenta_v2

I build this from scratch, files modified: XML, Java, drawable images and styles.

At first I decided to see what the current standard settings for Android Studio do... 
to quickly discover i wanted to switch back to use Relative and LinearLayouts. 

I also edited the Viejos image after placed in the folder... not sure how wise was that

After creating both the XML and Java files I changed from one '-2 Points' button to one per player

I'm not particularly confident I created the Toast not the onlyWayToFortyV | C booleans correctly

Last note, I had totally forgotten to add the onClick attribute to my Reset button.

I hope these notes help. Thank you so very much for any insights on how this can work.
