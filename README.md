<h2>Cuarenta, the game</h2>
<h3>Players</h3>
2 to 4 people. If 4 are playing, team partners seat across from each other.
<h3>Deck</h3>
Ace-7 are used together with Jack, Queen and Kings of all four suits.
The remaining cards are used to keep the score. 
<ul><h3>Deal</h3>
To determine who the first dealer will be, cards are dealt face up. The first player to receive a diamond is the first dealer.
<br>After a complete hand the turn to deal passes to the left.
<br>Failure to ask the opponent to shuffle cards the dealer looses 2 points.
<br>5 cards are dealt to each player. 
<h3>Ronda</h3>
As soon as a player sees his cards, he can call a Ronda.
<br>A Ronda means that whoever is claiming it has received 3 to cards of the same rank. If this was a false statement, this player will loose 2 points. Other player should take note.
<br>If there number of cards of the same rank is 4 the player who has them wind the entire game, the cards need to shown.
<h3>Playing</h3>
The following moves allow players to accumulate cards which will count for points.
<br><strong>NOTE:</strong> These points start counting at 6 only after the first 20 cards are taken in consideration, and will increase in pair numbers.
<br>For instance if you have 25 cards you will:
<li>Score 6 points because you have captured 20 cards</li>
<li>Score 6 additional points because they increase in pair number, a 5 will automatically give you 6 points. A 7 will give you 8 and so and so.</li>
<br><strong>Matching</strong>: When a player captures a card of the same rank from the table, and this card has been on the table for more than one play.
<br><strong>Addition</strong>: Addition can be done up to 7. Meaning a Jack cannot take a 7 and a 4. But a 7 can capture a 4 and a 3. Ace counts for 1.
<br><strong>Sequence</strong>: A player can capture the immediate next higher in rank card that is available on the table -only immediate higher-.
<br>This applies for addition plays. For instance if you have a 6 with which you will capture a 4 and a 2 AND there is a 7 and a Jack on the table, you can take all of them. As this would be understood like:
<br><ul><li>4 + 2 = 6</li>
<li>6 + 1 = 7 - implied addition</li>
<li>7 + 1 = 11 -Jack value-</li></ul>
<p>The following moves all score 2 points, these moves can be combined:
<ul>
<h4>Caida</h4>Snapping a card played in the immediate previous move grants you 2 points.
<br>If any player has reached 38 points it can only gain 2 points by performing this move - this is the most important rule in the game.
<h4>Limpia</h4>
If you happen to clean the table by any move you receive 2 points.<br>Caida can be combine with Limpia for a total of 4 points.</ul></ul>
